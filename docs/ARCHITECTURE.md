The repository owns provider-specific interpretation and portable contracts.
A future social orchestrator may coordinate multiple connectors through those
contracts, but it must not absorb provider credentials or policy decisions.

## Current components

- connector/manifest.json: declared capabilities and effect posture
- connector/schemas/: starter interoperability contracts
- connector/profiles/starter.json: secret-free offline profile
- src/: strict local credentials, bounded account/Pin reads, evidence normalization, CLI
- scripts/validate_connector.py: public-safety and identity checks
